# PyBer_Analysis
# Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights to the PyBer team on understand their customers needs, drivers needs, and utilization rates of their ride sharing app. The data source was shown with ride data for the city, date, total fare, a unique ride id number, as well as the number of drivers in each city. I used this data to calculate total ride volume for each type of city, average fare per ride, number of drivers per type of city, and the average fare per driver.  PyBer has segmented their data into rides in urban, suburban, and rural cities. I show a basic summary of the fare and ride breakdown into a dataframe, displayed below. The PyBer team can use this analysis to accurately allocate funding, investment, and resources into higher volume types of cities. 

# Results
Below is the summary data frame that I created to summarize the ride data by type of city.

In my analysis, I find a vast difference in ride and fare total volume in each of these segments. Urban cities, as expected, made up the vast share of the total rides, and produced the highest revenue. However, since these rides are typically shorter in length and distance, urban rides also on average had the lowest fare per rider.
